Well it's being 5+ years now for me in IT industry as a python developer, so sometimes there is a thought which keeps on running on my mind like why am I not focussing and learning on other new technologies which came into the market like React JS and Angular, so that by learning these technologies, I could also become a full stack developer and we know right there is always a huge demand for a full stack developer rather than the non full stack develpers.

So considering the above, I have already started learning the basics of React JS by watching and doing the practicals from YouTube videos and also from pluralsight website videos for the same. So within a span of 2 months, I am planning to build an application completely in React JS in the front end and Python in the backend and will definitely get it reviewed by one of the existing React JS + Python full stack developers in our company and will take his/her input or review comments and will implement those and hence by following this review process, I will gradually improve on my skills to become a skilled full stack developer and then so on.

Apart from being a techie, I also put some interest on extra curricular activities like playing the shuttle regularly which is becoming a stress buster for me which literally fades out all the stress and tensions which we usually get being a techie.

Well above is the thought plan of becoming a full stack developer very soon followed up with extra curricular activities.

Thanks.
